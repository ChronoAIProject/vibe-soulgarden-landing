By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

Please carefully review these Terms and all referenced documents before using the App. Pay particular attention to the section titled "Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability" and other sections that are emphasized in bold. It is crucial that you fully understand these Terms and assess the associated risks independently. WE DO NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, LEGAL, TAX, INVESTMENT OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL ADVICE.

1. CONFIRMATION AND ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS

A. Entire Agreement and Scope of Applicability
These Terms of Service, together with the Privacy Policy and any other documents explicitly incorporated by reference herein (collectively, the "Agreement"), constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between you ("User") and ChronoAI concerning the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications, proposals, or agreements, whether electronic, oral, or written.

This Agreement governs your access to and use of the SoulGarden application (the "App"), its proprietary content, and all services directly provided by ChronoAI. For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement specifically does not extend to, nor does ChronoAI assume any responsibility or liability for, decentralized applications (DApps), Smart Contracts, or other services developed, operated, or provided by third parties, even if such third-party services are accessible or linked through the App. Your engagement with any third-party DApps or services is governed solely by the terms and conditions established by those respective third parties.

B. Account Credentials and Identity
The User acknowledges and agrees that the App utilizes a unified authentication system shared with the related application, GodGPT. This means the login credentials, authentication tokens, and user identity established for your use of the App will also be used to access the GodGPT service, and vice versa.
Notwithstanding the shared login credentials: (A) Your use of the App is governed exclusively by this Agreement and the related Privacy Policy. (B) Your use of the GodGPT application is governed exclusively by the separate Terms of Service and Privacy Policy published by the operator of GodGPT.

C. Acceptance of Terms
By accessing or using any or all of the App, you expressly acknowledge that (i) you have read and understood these Terms; (ii) you agree to be bound by these Terms; and (iii) you are legally competent to enter into these Terms.

D. Modifications to these Terms
ChronoAI reserves the right to amend these Terms from time to time. Any updates will be communicated as required by applicable law, including revising the "Last Updated" date at the top of these Terms. In certain cases, additional notice may be provided, such as through a notice on the App or by contacting you directly. We encourage you to periodically review these Terms to stay informed about any such changes and decide whether or not to accept the revised version of these Terms. If you continue to use the App following any update or modification of the Terms, you shall be deemed to have accepted the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the Terms or any update or modification to the Terms, you must cease to access or use our App. Our App and its related services evolve over time. We may change or discontinue all or any part of the App, at any time and without prior notice, and at our sole discretion.

3. SERVICES

A. Personalised Readings
SoulGarden provides Users with proprietary, personalised interpretive content (the "Readings") generated solely by the App's algorithms and computational models. The Readings are delivered in various formats, which may include:
- Daily Readings: Short-form, predictive, or guiding content based on the User's provided birth data and the current date. These aim to offer daily insights into generalized mood tendencies, potential opportunities, cautions, and recommended focal points for the day.
- Annual Predictive Readings: A comprehensive, forward-looking analysis for the User's upcoming year, derived from proprietary astrological and metaphysical calculations. This content may cover broad life themes, including but not limited to career, relationships, financial outlook, health, and personal growth trajectories.
- Foundational (Lifetime) Readings: Interpretive content covering long-term archetypes, characteristic tendencies, elemental compositions (e.g., Bazi/五行 balance), dominant planetary influences, and macro life-stage patterns.
Disclaimer on Content Generation: All Readings are generated purely through automated means and computational logic. The content is not individually reviewed, verified, or endorsed by human professional consultants, astrologers, or metaphysical experts.

B. Hybrid Interpretive Framework
The App's analytical engine operates on a proprietary, hybrid interpretive framework, which may integrate data and principles from multiple established and supplementary systems, including:
- Bazi (Four Pillars of Destiny): Utilising the User's specific birth data (year, month, day, and time) for the computational interpretation of elemental strengths, favourable and unfavourable energetic influences, life path tendencies, and cyclical luck patterns.
- Western Astrology: Incorporating planetary positions and alignments based on the date, time, and location of birth (where provided), including the derivation of zodiac signs, house placements, and annual transit analysis.
- Supplementary Systems: The App reserves the right to incorporate additional interpretive models (e.g., specific numerological sequences, proprietary archetypal matrices, or proprietary metaphysical systems) designed to enhance, integrate, or contextualise the outputted Readings.
Proprietary Nature and Evolution: The specific analytical frameworks, interpretive logic, and weighting systems used by the SoulGarden platform are confidential and proprietary intellectual property of ChronoAI. These frameworks and the resulting content may be subject to ongoing refinement and evolution without prior notice to the User.

4. YOUR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS

A. Required Input for Computational Profile
To facilitate the generation of personalized Readings and to compute the User's astrological and metaphysical profile, the SoulGarden platform may require and process the following User-provided data:
- Date of Birth (Mandatory for core functionality).
- Time of Birth (Optional, but highly recommended for comprehensive analysis).
- Geographic Data (e.g., Time Zone or Place of Birth - Optional, but essential for accurate planetary house system calculations).
- User-Selected Preferences (Internal application settings that modulate content presentation or thematic focus).
This input data is processed solely and automatically by the App's computational engine for the purpose of generating the Readings.

B. Data Accuracy and Limitation
The User acknowledges that the precision and relevance of the generated Readings are directly contingent upon the accuracy and completeness of the data provided by the User. Where the User opts not to provide certain necessary information (e.g., exact time of birth or place of birth), the App may generate Readings based on partial or approximate data, which may materially affect the fidelity and interpretive depth of the resulting content.

C. Data Governance
Compliance with all applicable data protection laws, details regarding the collection, handling, storage, security, retention, and User rights concerning Personal Data are governed exclusively by the separate SoulGarden Privacy Policy. The User's acceptance of these Terms constitutes acceptance of the Privacy Policy.

10. BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.

A. Binding Arbitration
Any dispute, claim or controversy ("Claim") relating in any way to this Agreement, or your use of the App will be resolved by binding arbitration as provided in this Section 11, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.
i. If you are located in the United States: This agreement and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the expedited procedures set forth in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the "Rules") as those Rules exist on the effective date of this Agreement, including Rules 16.1 and 16.2 of those Rules. The arbitrator's decision shall be final, binding, and non-appealable. Judgment upon the award may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. Neither party shall sue the other party other than as provided herein or for enforcement of this clause or of the arbitrator's award; any such suit may be brought only in a Federal District Court or a Texas state court located in Tarrant County, Texas. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement including any claim that all or any part of the Agreement is void or voidable. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we and you waive any right to a jury trial. Notwithstanding the foregoing we and you both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
ii. If you are located in the United Kingdom: This Agreement and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of England and Wales. Any dispute, claim or controversy relating in any way to this Agreement, your use of the App, or to any products or services licensed or distributed by us will be resolved by binding arbitration as provided in this clause. Prior to commencing any formal arbitration proceedings, parties shall first seek settlement of any claim by mediation in accordance with the LCIA Mediation Rules, which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. If the dispute is not settled by mediation within 14 days of the commencement of the mediation, or such further period as the parties shall agree in writing, the dispute shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the LCIA Rules, which are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. The language to be used in the mediation and in the arbitration shall be English. The seat or legal place of arbitration shall be London.
iii. If you are located in any territory that is not specifically enumerated in Sections 11A(i) or 11A(ii):
- If you are located in any territory not specifically referenced in Sections 11A(i) or 11A(ii), you may elect for either Section 11A(i) or Section 11A(ii) to apply to you. Otherwise, this Agreement and any Claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it, or its subject matter or formation, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Singapore. Any Claim relating to this Agreement, your use of the App, or any products or services licensed or distributed by us, shall be resolved through binding arbitration.
- Prior to initiating formal arbitration, the parties shall first attempt to resolve the Claim by mediation in accordance with the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) Mediation Rules, which are incorporated by reference into this clause. If the dispute is not settled by mediation within 14 days of commencement, or within any other period agreed upon by the parties in writing, the Claim shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the SIAC Rules, which are also deemed incorporated into this clause.
- The arbitration tribunal shall consist of a single arbitrator. The parties shall mutually agree upon the appointment of the arbitrator. If the parties fail to agree on an arbitrator within 30 days of a party requesting arbitration, the arbitrator shall be appointed by the Chairman of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre. The language to be used in the mediation and arbitration shall be English.
- The arbitration shall be conducted in English. The seat or legal place of arbitration shall be Singapore.

B. Class Action Waiver
YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AND WE EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO FILE A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS. Unless both you and we agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

11. MISCELLANEOUS

A. Assignment
You will not assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any of your rights and obligations under this Agreement, without our prior written consent. Any assignment or transfer in violation of this Section 12 will be void. We may assign this Agreement and the Terms herein without your consent (a) in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or (b) to any Affiliate or as part of a corporate reorganization; and effective upon such assignment, the assignee is deemed substituted for us as a party to this Agreement and we are fully released from all of our obligations and duties to perform under this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

B. Entire Agreement
These Terms set forth the entire understanding and agreement as to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior discussions, agreements, and understandings of any kind (including, without limitation, any prior versions of the Terms) and every nature between us.

C. Severability
If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect. The invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted, to the extent possible, to fulfill the original intent. If such interpretation is not feasible, the invalid or unenforceable provision will be severed from this Agreement, and the remaining terms will remain fully operative and enforceable.

D. Independent Contractors; Non-Exclusive Rights
The relationship between you and ChronoAI is that of independent contractors. Nothing in these Terms shall be construed as creating a partnership, joint venture, agency, fiduciary, or employment relationship between the parties. Neither party has the authority to act on behalf of or bind the other in any way. Both parties retain the right to independently develop or have developed products, services, systems, or techniques that may be similar to or competitive with the other party's offerings. Additionally, both parties may provide assistance to third-party developers or systems integrators who may offer products or services that compete with the other party's offerings.
