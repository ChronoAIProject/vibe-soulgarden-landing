This Privacy Policy describes how SoulGarden ("the App," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares your personal information when you interact with our AI-powered wellness application. SoulGarden is a tool for personal development, manifestation, and habit formation; it does not provide medical, mental health, or predictive spiritual advice.

We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any updates will be communicated as required by applicable law, including revising the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Policy. By continuing to use our Services after any updates become effective, you acknowledge and agree to the revised Policy.

This Privacy Policy forms an integral part of the SoulGarden Terms of Service (https://soulgarden.chrono-ai.fun/terms/ the "Terms"). Capitalized terms used in this Policy but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms. It is important that you read this Privacy Policy in conjunction with any other privacy or fair processing notices we may provide at the time we collect or process personal data about you, to fully understand how and why your data is being used. This Policy supplements other notices and legal agreements, including the Terms, and is not intended to override them.

We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy or our practices with regard to your personal information, please contact us at any time.

- With Your Consent: We may disclose your personal information for any other purpose with your explicit consent.

5. Transfer of Information

Your information is processed at our operating offices in Singapore and in any other place where the parties involved in processing are located. This means your data may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your jurisdiction where data protection laws may differ.

Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and no transfer of your personal data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal information.

6. Data Storage and Retention

- Retention: We retain your Personal Data only for as long as necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy. No purpose in this Policy will require us to keep your information for longer than 2 years.
- Deletion Rights: You have the right to delete or request assistance in deleting the Personal Data we have collected. You may update or delete your information at any time by signing into your account settings.
- Legal Obligations: We may need to retain certain information when we have a legal obligation or lawful basis to do so (e.g., tax or accounting requirements).

7. Maintaining Security

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect your information. However, no electronic transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure; therefore, transmission of personal information to and from our App is at your own risk.

8. Your Rights and Choices

Depending on your location (e.g., Singapore PDPA, EU GDPR, or California CCPA), you may have the right to:
- Access & Portability: Request a copy of the data we hold about you.
- Correction & Deletion: Update inaccurate info or request total deletion of your account.
- Withdraw Consent: Stop data processing by deleting your account or contacting us.

To exercise these rights, please visit your account settings or contact us at our instagram page (https://www.instagram.com/soulgarden.app/).

9. Children's Privacy

Our Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or 16 in the EEA). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without parental consent, we will take steps to delete such information and terminate the child's account.

10. Controls For Do-not-track Features

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.

11. Important Disclaimers

- Wellness Purpose Only: SoulGarden is a self-help tool. It does not guarantee manifestation outcomes, nor is it a substitute for professional medical or mental health treatment.
- Children's Privacy: Our services are intended for users aged 13 (or 16 in certain jurisdictions) and older. We do not knowingly collect data from children under these ages.

12. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy periodically. Changes are effective immediately upon posting the revised "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this page frequently.
